    "# HybridVectorizer — S&P 500 Demo (Colab)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to run **HybridVectorizer** on a real mixed-modality dataset (text + numeric + categorical) using S&P 500 company data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you’ll do\n",
    "- Install `hybrid-vectorizer` (1 line).\n",
    "- Load a ready-to-use CSV (auto-download from GitHub or upload your own).\n",
    "- Configure columns by modality (text / numeric / categorical).\n",
    "- Fit the vectorizer and build a unified vector space.\n",
    "- Run `similarity_search` and **tune block weights** to see how neighbors change.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this is useful\n",
    "Typical vector search ignores numeric/categorical columns or smashes everything into text. **HybridVectorizer** keeps modality blocks separate and combines them with **tunable weights**, so you can trade off signals (e.g., favor fundamentals vs. description text).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick start\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# If running on Colab:\n",
    "# !pip install -q hybrid-vectorizer\n",
    "# Optional ANN:  # !pip install -q faiss-cpu\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "- **CC0 (Public Domain)**: [S&P 500 Stocks (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/sp-500-stocks)  \n",
    "- For this demo, we load:  \n",
    "  `https://github.com/hariharaprabhu/hybrid-vectorizer/blob/main/Examples/Similar%20Stock%20Tickers/sp500_companies.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "- GPU is optional (install CUDA-enabled PyTorch if you want faster text embeddings).\n",
    "- You can swap in your own CSV with the same column names.\n",
    "- Results are shown as a small table (symbol, sector, industry, similarity).\n"
